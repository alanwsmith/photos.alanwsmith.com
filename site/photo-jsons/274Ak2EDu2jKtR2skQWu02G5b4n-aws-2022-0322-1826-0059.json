The seat is made of six wood strips that are turning a corner in the frame. The strips start and end on the left side of the image with the round point of their triangle just short of the middle of the right edge of the frame. The wood in the foreground is dark. The wood at the top is almost white with the reflection of the sky above it. The background of the image is a rough sidewalk with a cross of expansion lines visible in the upper right of the image.","image_ratio":1,"original_width":3114,"original_height":3114}
