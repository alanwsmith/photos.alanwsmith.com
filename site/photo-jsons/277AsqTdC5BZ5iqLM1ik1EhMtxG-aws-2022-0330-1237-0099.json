The glass sphere of the machine starts at the upper corners of the frame and curves in and down to just below the middle of the frame. It contains a full assortment of gumballs ranging in shades from black to white. The reflection of a window shows in the glass at the top toward the left side. A logo with a crown and the words \"DUBBLE BUBBLE\" in all caps is visible on a few of the gumballs including the one most prominent in the center of the collection. Below the glass sphere is the coin mechanism. It's a dark shade that tapers in slightly and it descends below the glass sphere. A black circle with white text of the number twenty-five is in the middle of the coin mechanism stand. It's slightly out of focus due to the depth of field. Below it is the hand knob for turning a coin into the machine to get a gumball.","image_ratio":0.7951880307319046,"original_width":4946,"original_height":3933}
