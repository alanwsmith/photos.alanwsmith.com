The water takes up the entire frame. The lower portion of the frame from the left edge to the right is pure black and the upper portion is pure white from the reflection of a clear sky. The majority of the image is take up with small ripples in the water. They barely reflect the sky towards the bottom and increase until they become completely washed out at the top. The overall effect is one of a gradient transitioning between black and white.","image_ratio":1,"original_width":3400,"original_height":3400}
