The first wall starts on the left side of the frame and moves two thirds of the way across the frame. The curve of the way causes the gaps between the wood strips to appear thinner and thinner as it progresses. The second wall is more straight on to the camera with the space between the strips staying relatively constant. The difference in visible gaps causes the right third of the frame to be darker than the left.","image_ratio":0.6238303181534622,"original_width":4809,"original_height":3000}
