The image is high contrast making the water black and the pollen almost totally white. There is a main branch of pollen extending from the right side of the frame and forking off light lightning to the left. In between some of the forks are swirls and bands that mimic the curvature with a larger dusted area coming in from the left. The pollen is mostly on the lower two thirds of the image with the upper third mostly the black of the water with a few ripples showing in light gray. Specs of pollen and strewn throughout the black areas like stars in the night sky.","image_ratio":0.8698460009935419,"original_width":4026,"original_height":3502}
