The image was taken at an angle that makes the corner appear like a pyramid showing two sides. The point of the pyramid is in the upper left third of the image. The side to the left crosses out of the image half way down the left site. The side on the right cuts down at an angle and leaves the frame on the bottom most of the way to the right. The walls have a texture of small, random wavy lines. A thing strip of metal flashing bands the top of the walls with a few rain drops scattered across.","image_ratio":0.6666666666666666,"original_width":6000,"original_height":4000}
